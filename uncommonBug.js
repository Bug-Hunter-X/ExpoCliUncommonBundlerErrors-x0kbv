This error typically occurs when you're using Expo's `expo start` command, and the Metro bundler (which handles JavaScript code) encounters a problem.  It often manifests as a cryptic error message, not providing much context. It's usually indicative of issues within your app's codebase, dependencies, or the Expo CLI's configuration itself. For example, a common symptom is the bundler getting stuck, not giving any output and not letting you proceed.
